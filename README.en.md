# oglight
OGLight is an easy-to-do script, the goal is to add a lot of functionality to the game without having to configure anybody for hours.

## repatriation of resources
Using OGLight, you can repatriate all your resources from all your planets or lunes to a destination (the destination is one of your planets or lunes). If you want to repatriate all the resources of your planets, visit the first planet from which you want to see a discolle return and click on the blue button with the end symbol:

A popup will appear and ask you to choose a destination to which you want to repatriate your resources:

Select a destination from your planets or lunes (you can also select the associated moon from the same name button):

You will then be brought to the first planet/unea fleet menu you have selected. You can only use the "entry" key in a loop (or maintain it) so that the script is responsible for sending resources to the desired location.

Note: The mission used (transpo/statio) and the type of vessel sent will depend on the parameters defined in the right hand menu.

In order to "save" a planet during the process, it is possible to use the "o" key (or the right-hand button under the list of planets).

Once a complete loop has been completed, the script automatically leaves the "repatriation mode".
# construction lock
You can "wash" all the buildings you want via the following button:

Once you have clicked above, a cadenas will appear next to the planet/one in question:

Once this button is clicked, a new window will appear

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1087731/189495536-67f58644-0812-43d6-b6ed-58cfe4f61325.png "")

You can then remove a locked building or send resources directly to the desired location.

Notes:

- The mission used (transpo/statio) and the type of vessel sent will depend on the parameters defined in the right hand menu.
- It is possible to post and lock upper levels using the arrows beside the locking button.
- For the fleet and defence, the number locked will depend on the number indicated in the field (which is normally used to start construction).
- The resources sent are broken down into the sum indicated by the cadenas and thus can be supplemented with resources from other planets/lunes.

# minimum resources to be kept
You can identify a minimum number of resources to keep on your planets/lunes.

For this it is enough to go to the Fleet View No. 3:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1087731/189495585-af23480b-e3f8-4f66-bc79-abb3485961a2.png "")

Once this button is clicked, you will be able to define the amount of resources to be left on TOUTES.
# dispatch of facilitated resources
You can automatically select the number of vessels required for transport by clicking here in Fleet View No 1:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1087731/189495591-73904a9c-85d8-45e4-be3b-19d4b86734bf.png "")

A window will allow you to define the amount of resources to be sent and, once indicated, the script will select the number of carriers to send.
# mark targets
OGLight allows you to mark targets by giving them colour.

To do this, you need to go to the "galaxy" view and click here.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1087731/189495601-e77e3df0-1b36-4da9-b5c4-234d5f6ea004.png "")

You can then choose a colour to give it what will make it more visible in the "galaxy" view.

Notes:

- the grey colour is the fact that "don't know" the target is what will make it less visible.
- It is possible to mark all the planets of a player by flying over its pseudo and selecting a colour directly here:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1087731/189495612-de2005e8-746a-4ed2-b4fb-213a099db277.png "")

The list of marked targets can be accessed by clicking here:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1087731/189495614-56b1fbce-0001-4616-8ad3-57a1dec69d6c.png "")

This has the effect of opening this window on the right:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1087731/189495620-67cdcc0e-f08d-4042-a3cb-8387a06c77e2.png "")

The targets are sorted by galaxies and prosecution (of 50) systems.

Note: some targets can be displayed/masked by clicking on top colour.

Click on the coordinates to open the "galaxy" view to the desired position.

Click on the planet's icone allows you to sink the planet/lune.

The flag icone defines "the next target". Once this is selected, it is necessary to go to the Fleet View No. 1. It is then possible to use the "t" key (or the right button under the list of planets). This will have the effect of stirring the target. It is then enough to use the "entry" key several times to launch an attack.

Note:

The type of selected vessels depends on the parameters defined in the right menu.

The number of vessels sent depends on the RVal (definable in OGL options).

Once the target is reached, the following target (in the list of targets) will then automatically take the flag and then be stirred by using the "t" key. This makes it possible to quickly pull the targets of the list.
# espionage reports table
OGlight can read the data from your spying reports to sort them in a table.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1087731/189495628-bcee5886-3d3b-436a-9bc5-675f1aff58c0.png "")

In this table, click on the player's name allows for full details of the report.

Targets can be identified directly in the table.

Notes:

- This functionality is deactivable in OGL options.
- The script can only sort out the reports displayed. It is therefore advisable to define the number of messages per page at most (50) directly in the options for GMOs (Options / Postings / Messages).
- In OGLight options, it is possible to activate/deactivate the automatic deletion of "inactive" reports. A report is considered "intriguing" if looting resources are below the RVal (see OGLight options) AND there is no dock fleet.
